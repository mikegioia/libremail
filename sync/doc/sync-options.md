## Sync Options

Before you begin, you can run `./sync --help` to see a list of what options you
have. Below is an explanation of the options you can specify when running this
script:

* `--actions | -a`

  Run the sync script in actions-only mode. This disables downloading the
  messages and attachments and instead only syncs the pending actions to the
  IMAP server.

* `--background | -b`

  Defaults disabled. This runs the application in the background as a daemon.
  Use this if you'd like to run the syncing engine from an init script, a cron,
  a systemd service, managed via a hypervisor, or any other method of
  watchdogging or monitoring a PHP script.

* `--create | -c`

  Run the sync script but only prompt for adding a new IMAP account.

* `--daemon | -d`

  Run the sync script in daemon mode. This supresses output to the console
  and instead writes everything to the log files.

* `--diagnostics | -D`

  Runs through the diagnostic tests and reports any errors. Use this to start
  debugging any failures.

* `--email <address> | -e <address>`

  Runs the sync script for the specified email account only. By default, the
  sync engine will run over all active accounts but this flag takes priority.

* `--folder <folder> | -f <folder>`

  Runs the sync script for the specified folder only, and then halts. This is
  useful when running in interactive mode to download one specific folder if
  you're testing something, or if you want to just have an external script
  download, say, your Inbox separately from the entire mailbox. The `<folder>`
  argument is the full name of the IMAP folder: 'INBOX', or 'Accounts/Support'
  are examples.

* `--help | -h`

  Print the help message.

* `--interactive | -i`

  **Defaults to enabled**. This runs the application interactively, or in a mode
  designed for the CLI (command line interface). Messages are printed to the
  screen and you could be prompted to enter data for certain actions (like
  creating a new account).

* `--quick | -q`

  Runs the sync in quick mode. This skips downloading attachments and message
  conten. It can be useful for testing and debugging large mailboxes.

* `--rollback | -r`

  Roll-back any un-committed tasks in the tasks database. These tasks are added
  when you interact with the web clients. The sync script will look for tasks
  and commit them to the IMAP server.

* `--sleep | -s`

  Run the sync script in sleep mode. This keeps the entire sync disabled and
  will not make any IMAP connections or do anything but respond to signals. It
  can be helpful for signal testing.

* `--threading | -t`

  Run the sync script in threading mode. This skips download messages and goes
  straight to performing a threading operation. It can be useful for debugging.

* `--updatedb | -u`

  Updates the database by running the migration scripts in `db/`. These scripts
  will only run once so you can run this as many times as you'd like.
